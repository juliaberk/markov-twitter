I got purple in my swisher
Purple in my car
Purple, purple in my wine clap
Purple label up
Grapes what's up
Grape, grape, grapes, what's up
Breakfast
Oh it's kreay baby,
Oh hey, baby
I get to work you just lazy baby
I need my break now when where and how
This second right here with a couple pounds
I be town down dropping in the scraper
I've been around my world doing shows and getting paper
Need my medicine, again, again
I'm with 2 chainz with two bricks in two hands
I-I-I-I'm hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay? heck no, playboy bunny
Bout that juice cheese bread breakfast
Stackin dough breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got I got all the syrup
Bout that juice cheese bread breakfast
Stackin dough
Eight in the morning and I'm up yawning
My phones almost dead cause everyone is calling
It's breakfast time and I need my apple jacks
And I need my fresh grape syrup and a money stack
We're just popping off just to kill shit
And we drink a lot til we don't feel shit
She's in her birthday suit and she's cooking too
Yea it's breakfast time but it's only two
I-I-I-I'm hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay? heck no, playboy bunny
Bout that juice cheese bread breakfast
Stackin' dough breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got I got all the syrup
Bout that juice cheese bread breakfast
Stackin' dough
2 Chainz!, I'm up now
Smoking on that loud till the sun down
Beating on that pussy till the sun up
You don't like what we doing shut the fuck up
Me and kreay that's all I gotta say
I don see a lil nigga the money in the way
Lil wayne unquote did it from the A
When I'm in California bitch I'm try'na fornicate
If you ain't talking money ain't no need to conversate.
I-I-I-I'm hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay? heck no, playboy bunny
Bout that juice cheese bread breakfast
Stackin dough breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got I got all the syrup
Bout that juice cheese bread breakfast
Stackin dough.
